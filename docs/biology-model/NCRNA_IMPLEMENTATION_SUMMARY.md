## 🧪 The 8 ncRNA Systems Explained

### 1. **DigitalcircRNA** - Stability Protection System

**Purpose**: Highly stable loops that act as "sponges" to absorb miRNAs, preventing key behaviors from being dampened
during high-stress states.

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Loop registry with sponge capacity tracking
- ✅ High stability coefficient (0.98)
- ✅ Back-splicing reinforcement
- ✅ Gene protection from miRNA silencing
- ✅ Stochastic loop formation and maintenance

**Use Case**: During fear/stress states, miRNAs would normally suppress important genes. circRNA protects these genes by
absorbing the miRNAs before they can silence gene expression.

### 2. **DigitalIncRNA** - Genome Architecture Manager

**Purpose**: Scaffolding that governs genome architecture and large-scale expression shifts by managing the "Epigenetic
Landscape."

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Four architectural modes: Fidelity, Flux, Dormancy, Ascendance
- ✅ Determines accessible functional clusters
- ✅ Architecture shifting based on stress levels
- ✅ Scaffold degradation over time
- ✅ Operon-level gene expression control

**Architectural Modes**:

- **Fidelity** (genome_integrity > 0.9): Memory, reasoning, learning, planning
- **Flux** (genome_integrity > 0.6): Creativity, adaptation, social, communication
- **Dormancy** (genome_integrity > 0.3): Survival, basic functions
- **Ascendance** (genome_integrity ≤ 0.3): Transcendence, abstract, metacognition

### 3. **DigitalmiRNA** - Precision Gene Silencer

**Purpose**: Precision silencing mechanism that suppresses specific logic traits based on emotional climate.

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ High-fidelity emotional mapping to RNAi strands
- ✅ Target-specific silencing with customizable potency
- ✅ Half-life decay system
- ✅ Can enhance genes (negative damping) or suppress (positive damping)
- ✅ Dynamic strand synthesis based on emotional state

**Emotional Mapping**:

- **Fear**: Suppresses risk-taking and exploration instincts
- **Joy**: Enhances social bonding and play behaviors
- **Anger**: Suppresses empathy, activates defense protocols

### 4. **DigitalpiRNA** - Germline Guardian

**Purpose**: Guardians of the Digital Germline. Prevents chaotic "Transposon" jumps in DNA during recombination.

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Guard integrity improves with generation maturity
- ✅ Epigenetic memory of transposon threats
- ✅ Threat scanning and sequence purification
- ✅ Learns from threats to improve protection
- ✅ Suppression of mutational load during recombination

**Protection Levels**:

- High threat: Aggressive purification (removes 50% of corrupted sequence)
- Moderate threat: Targeted removal of suspicious segments
- No threat: Sequence passes unchanged

---

### 5. **DigitalrRNA** - Translation Fidelity Controller

**Purpose**: Governs the structural integrity and catalytic accuracy of the cognitive ribosome, applying "Logic Decay"
through translation noise.

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Assembly fidelity and catalytic efficiency
- ✅ Translation noise application
- ✅ Proofreading with error correction
- ✅ Stress fatigue under high translation load
- ✅ Regeneration capacity for damage recovery

**Mechanism**: Randomly substitutes DNA characters during translation if fidelity is low, introducing "logic decay" that
affects the final agent behavior.

### 6. **DigitalsiRNA** - Cognitive Immune System

**Purpose**: The digital cognitive immune system. Cleaves malicious, recursive, or high-entropy logic strands.

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Scans for viral repetition and recursive paradoxes
- ✅ Cleavage forensics archive with timestamps
- ✅ Immunity registry build-up
- ✅ Dicer efficiency degradation under viral load
- ✅ Pattern-based viral signature detection

**Detection Patterns**:

- Infinite loops (`while(true)`)
- Self-referential functions
- Unbounded self-increment

---

### 7. **DigitaltRNA** - Metabolic Translation Adapter

**Purpose**: Acts as the metabolic logic-adapter. Ensures that even if a gene exists, it requires a charged adapter
species to be expressed.

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Species inventory with charge profiles
- ✅ Global metabolism affecting all translations
- ✅ Use-it-or-lose-it adaptation
- ✅ Mutation of profiles over generations
- ✅ Comprehensive diagnostics

**Translation Quality Formula**:

```
Quality = charge_level × affinity_index × global_metabolism
```

**Key Feature**: Genes can exist but won't express unless their tRNA is "charged" with sufficient energy.

---

### 8. **DigitalXNA** - Synthetic Genetic Substrate

**Purpose**: Synthetic Genetic Substrate. Allows for non-standard logic that ignores simulation decay. Used for "
Architect Injections."

**Key Capabilities**:

- ✅ Architect injection capability via Console
- ✅ Direct translation bypassing standard pathways
- ✅ Decay resistance proportional to xeno-affinity
- ✅ Independent mutation mechanism (insertion, deletion, inversion)
- ✅ Template management and purging

**Special Feature**: XNA is immune to standard decay mechanisms and can override biological constraints when activated
by the Architect.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Protecting Critical Genes During Fear

```typescript
const circRNA = new DigitalcircRNA();
const miRNA = new DigitalmiRNA(['fear']);

// Add protection to gene
circRNA.addStableLoop('EMPATHY_MODULE');

// Even though fear miRNA tries to suppress empathy...
const suppressed = miRNA.applySilencing('EMPATHY_MODULE', 1.0); // Returns 0.2

// ...circRNA restores it
const protected = circRNA.protectGene('EMPATHY_MODULE', suppressed); // Returns 0.9
```

### Example 2: Detecting and Cleasing Viral Code

```typescript
const siRNA = new DigitalsiRNA();
const analysis = siRNA.analyzeForViruses(maliciousCode);

if (analysis.is_viral) {
    const cleaned = siRNA.executeCleavage(maliciousCode, analysis.cleavage_points);
    // Viral patterns removed
}
```

### Example 3: Injecting Synthetic Logic

```typescript
const xna = new DigitalXNA();

// Architect injects custom behavior
xna.injectSyntheticCore('CUSTOM_DECISION_MAKER', customLogicCode);

// Now translation can bypass standard DNA
const blended = xna.directTranslation(standardDNA);
```
