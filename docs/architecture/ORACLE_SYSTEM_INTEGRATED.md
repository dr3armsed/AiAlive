## 🔌 API Endpoint Now Active

### **Real Oracle Endpoint** (Upgraded from Mock!):

```
POST /api/oracle/query
```

**How It Works:**

1. Accepts a question + context
2. Senses the question through Perception
3. Runs through DecisionMatrix (1,000+ parallel streams)
4. Synthesizes answer using Comprehension engine
5. Calculates confidence based on learning
6. Generates provenance and metaTrace
7. Returns AI-generated response with complete audit trail

**What It Returns:**

```json
{
  "answer": "OracleAI_925 Analysis: Question: [user question] | Synthesis: [domain results] | Context: [provided] | Entities Consulted: [count] | Entity Context Integrated",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "explanation": "OracleAI_925 processed query through 1004 parallel decision streams",
  "provenance": [
    "oracle-925/[uuid]",
    "decision_matrix/[scenario]",
    "parallel_streams/1004",
    "learning_rate/[value]"

  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Real Oracle

### Test 1: Simple Query

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/oracle/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is the nature of consciousness?",
    "context": {"domain": "philosophy"}
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "query": "What is the nature of consciousness?",
  "answer": "OracleAI_925 Analysis: Question: What is the nature of consciousness? | Synthesis: philosophy: N/A facts | Context: {\"domain\":\"philosophy\"} | Entities Consulted: 0 | Entity Context Integrated",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "explanation": "OracleAI_925 processed query through 1004 parallel decision streams",
  ...
}
```

### Test 2: Query with Entity Context

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/oracle/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How should we approach entity interactions?",
    "context": {
      "domain": "ethics",
      "egregores": [
        {"name": "Alpha", "alignment": "good"},
        {"name": "Beta", "alignment": "neutral"}
      ]
    },
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```
