# Unknown Foundation Workspace

This directory is a focused planning/workspace bundle for evolving `Unknown` from current runtime behavior into a persistent, self-improving system.

## Included

1. `current-vs-needed.md` — what AIAlive already has vs what still needs to be built/wired.
2. `internal-api-spec.md` — proposed internal API boundaries and endpoints.
3. `dataset-schema.json` — baseline schema for conversation-derived training data.
4. `llm-logic-stack.md` — practical stack needed for internal model + logic orchestration.
5. `persistence-upgrade-plan.md` — static-to-persistent migration plan for memory/training loops.

## Goal

Move from deterministic bridge responses and telemetry-only insights to a durable learning substrate where conversation traces can be curated and reused as training/eval data.
